# HANDOFF.md
**The append-only handoff log. Every agent writes an entry here BEFORE stopping; the founder reads at merge time and at the 21:00 sweep.**

How this file works:

- **Newest entry at the top**, directly under this header block.
- **Agents append entries; they never edit or delete existing ones.** A correction is a new entry referencing the old.
- **One entry per task**, written even when the task failed or was blocked. A blocked entry containing one specific question is a successful handoff; the founder answers in the relevant spec doc, then replies "updated <doc>, follow it."
- **Division of labor with the other files:** TASKBOARD.md holds STATUS (the founder syncs it from entries here). DECISIONS.md holds RULINGS. This file holds the NARRATIVE: what was built, what was found, what the next session needs to know. An agent session starts amnesiac; this log is its memory of yesterday.
- **Never in this file:** secret values, tokens, keys, connection strings. If you found a credential somewhere it should not be, write one line ("credential found in <file>") without reproducing it.
- **Archive policy:** after a task's branch merges and its day's gate passes, the founder may move its entry to `docs/handoffs/` to keep this file short. Entries from the current and previous day always stay here.

## Entry template (copy exactly)

```md
## <Task ID> — <branch> — <YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM> — <agent>
**Built:** one or two sentences, plain language.
**Files changed:** list (must match the allowed list; the guard script output goes here if it flagged anything).
**Tests run:** exact command + result (e.g., `pytest tests/test_ephemeris.py -q` → 14 passed, 2 skipped PENDING_JHORA).
**Known issues / deferred:** list, or "none".
**Next agent should read:** files, or "n/a".
**Tempted but did not:** anything you wanted to change outside scope (this line catches scope pressure before it becomes scope creep).
**Question (only if BLOCKED):** one specific question, then stop.
```

## T0.0 — (no branch, pre-sprint state) — 2026-06-11 08:30 — founder
**Built:** seed entry recording the June 10 state so every agent session inherits the same truth. Backend (FastAPI) live on Azure Container Apps with `/health` (minimal 3-field version) and `/chart/generate` (body: birth_date, birth_time, birth_city; header `X-User-Id`); Supabase `user_charts` caching proven MISS→HIT; image `ghcr.io/pratyus-saha/askjunopath-backend:v1.0.0` (public package); Next.js frontend live on Vercel via CLI with `/` and `/chart`.
**Files changed:** n/a (state record).
**Tests run:** none exist yet; that is the point of today.
**Known issues / deferred:**
- Chart math UNVALIDATED against reference software; treat all existing chart output as untrusted (PROJECT_CONTEXT.md §3).
- Placidus cusps and houses NOT computed anywhere yet.
- `SE_EPHE_PATH` / `.se1` files never mentioned in the June 10 work; production may be running Moshier-fallback ephemeris. First check of today's afternoon block (TASKBOARD T1.5, DECISIONS D013).
- `user_charts` rows created before today's validation are suspect; diff-then-flush procedure pending (D013).
- A GitHub PAT was exposed in a terminal screenshot on June 10; revocation is task T1.0 and must be confirmed in the next entry.
- Supabase column is `chart_json`, not `chart` (already fixed once; do not regress).
- CORS unhardened; rate limits absent; both scheduled June 21.
**Next agent should read:** docs/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md, AGENTS.md, then your task's spec doc per TASKBOARD.md.
**Tempted but did not:** n/a.
